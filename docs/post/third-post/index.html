      <p>One of the biggest elements and one of the most difficult and one that stymied me for an
extended period is containing the pressure of compulsion, the need to be in the market. Great
quote from Jesse Livermore in the Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, &ldquo;I made the most money
when I just sat.&rdquo; Learning that patience, learning to stand by your plan, not feeling the need that
trading is consistent, regular, order entry, and tampering and tinkering. Ronald Reagan said it best
when he said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just do something, stand there.&rdquo; Particularly when you think of government,
I can see the reality and value in that, but it has a great parallel in trading. Do your analysis, do
your research, spend most of your time outside of the market analyzing, determining your high
probability trade. Then you place it, you let it trigger, and it&rsquo;s for all the right reasons and you
stand by it. You don&rsquo;t tinker.
In other words it&rsquo;s the right not to be in the market. We have power over the brokers and the
market makers. They have certain benefits, they might even have inside information and
knowledge that we are not always privy to, but do we as individual traders have any power? Yes
we do. A market maker has to offer a bid or a spread. The pressure is continually on him. He must
offer a bid in an offer. In highly volatile times he can stretch it a bit, but at the end of the day he
has to be in the game. He has to be equally prepared to buy or sell and underwrite. If you are a
market maker, that is the pressure that is on you.
As a trader we have the right not to be in the market and to choose the exact moments and the
exact terms and conditions under which we will engage. Think of it as a fisherman. You don&rsquo;t want
to enter into the ocean when the storm is on and it&rsquo;s coming in for dusk, you want to be able to
choose the best conditions for catching fish and nice, safe, stable seas. Learning to be highly
selective is a massive art, skill and science. A wait for ideal criteria, and we&rsquo;ll get further into what
is ideal criteria as we move our way along.
Many of us don&rsquo;t understand the nature of the game. What is a truly rounded winning result? Is it
 just the most or the highest number in an absolute sense per annum that can be attained as
percentage growth? Does the man who gets 36 percent at the end of a year beat the man who
gets 11 percent? Well, it depends. There&rsquo;s so much more to that assessment and I&rsquo;ll be giving you
some detail on that.
Lack of charting, proper charting based homework. In other words, go and do the research, draw
your lines, key levels of support and resistance….look historically where the underlying market has
reacted and the depth of trade assessment. We must look at a trade before putting it on at a far
greater level. Do you draw all your lines, look for all your patterns historical going forward, assess
your trends across multi time frames, across markets, intra-market analysis with all other
correlated markets? Are you the kind of person that does that level or degree or work each time
you are preparing for a key trade? In many instances the answer is you come in light on your
trading homework.
When we talk more about the nature of the game it&rsquo;s not necessarily about the absolute
maximum in any given year. Firstly you have to survive every year and stay in the game. It&rsquo;s a case
in the footballing analogy is not letting the others score any points against you. A great defence
means you get to come back and fight another day. This keeps you in the game for those special
days when you are well positioned and ready to exploit the market opportunity.</p>
