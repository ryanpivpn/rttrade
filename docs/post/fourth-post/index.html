    <h1 class="title">Terminology</h1>
      
    <div class="content">
      

<h1 id="stock">Stock</h1>

<p>A stock is a piece of ownership in a company. For instance, if you buy a stock in Walmart, you own a part of the retail store. Day traders buy company stocks with the aim of making profit at the end of the trading day.</p>

<h1 id="stockbroker">Stockbroker</h1>

<p>A stockbroker is a regulated professional who is responsible for buying and selling stocks, as well as other securities for stock traders through a stock exchange. They get a fee or commission for doing that. Essentially, a stockbroker links a stock trader to a stock market.</p>

<h1 id="stock-market">Stock market</h1>

<p>It’s a place where buyers and sellers come together at any given time to trade stocks.</p>

<h1 id="online-brokerages">Online brokerages</h1>

<p>They are like stock brokers; only they are institutions that allow you to create an account with them in order to buy stocks easily. Basically, you transfer money from your bank account into these brokerage accounts to easily invest in stocks.</p>

<h1 id="bull-market">Bull market</h1>

<p>A bull market situation is where stocks are going up or are projected to go up. That means the entire stock market is doing great. A bull market means there is great optimism, trader confidence and greater possibilities for higher ROI.</p>

<h1 id="bear-market">Bear market</h1>

<p>Bear market is the exact opposite of bull market. In this market, stocks are on a downward spiral. Bear market is characterized by plummeting prices and typically shrouded in pessimism. This kind of market typically manifests during economic recessions and depressions.</p>

<p>Smart day traders can benefit from both bull markets and bear markets by utilizing strategies and ideas that can bring in greater returns under different conditions. Short Selling, Put Option, and Short ETFs (short Exchange Traded Fund) are the main ways to profit from a bear market.</p>

<p>Smart traders can also profit from a bull market through Long Positions, Call Option, and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).</p>

<h1 id="buy">Buy</h1>

<p>It means buying stocks in a company. A day trader buys stocks in a company and sells them before the close of the day’s trading.</p>

<h1 id="sell">Sell</h1>

<p>This means selling of stocks that you’ve purchased. Traders can decide to sell their stocks because they’ve accomplished their objective or because they want to cut their losses.</p>

<h1 id="liquidity">Liquidity</h1>

<p>Liquidity is the ability of your stock to be turned into cash quickly. For example, money in a bank is highly liquid, which means you can instantly get to it whenever you want some. A house, on the other hand, is not liquid because it might take you time to turn it into cash. Day traders, in particular, need to choose high liquid stocks as their aim is to buy and sell quickly (on the same day).</p>

<h1 id="ask">Ask</h1>

<p>Ask represents the price that a stock seller is willing to accept from a stock buyer to get rid of their stock.</p>

<h1 id="bid">Bid</h1>

<p>Bid is the highest amount of price a stock trader is ready to pay to buy shares of a given stock.</p>

<h1 id="spread">Spread</h1>

<p>If you subtract the Ask price from the Bid price, you get the spread.</p>

<h1 id="close">Close</h1>

<p>Close represents the final stock price at the end of the day’s trading.</p>

<h1 id="short-term-trader">Short term trader</h1>

<p>A short-term trader seeks to hold out stocks for a few weeks or a few months before selling. Short term traders usually predict that a certain stock is going to rise in a few weeks or months and buy the stock. They later sell the stocks when the prices have actually gone up and make huge profits.</p>

<h1 id="long-term-investor">Long-term investor</h1>

<p>Unlike a day trader, a long-term investor seeks to invest in a stock for the long-term (a minimum of one year). Normally, long-term investors think of 3, 5, to 10 years.</p>

<h1 id="day-trader">Day trader</h1>

<p>Unlike a long-term trader, a day trader seeks to make profits by buying a stock or stocks each day and selling before the close of trading day.</p>

<h1 id="short-seller">Short seller</h1>

<p>This is a stocker trader who predicts that a stock price or the whole market will go down and so they sell their stock at that moment. When the stock price actually goes down, they buy back their stock at a much lower price. Essentially, they are betting on the market going down to make profits on stock sales.</p>

<h1 id="ipo">IPO</h1>

<p>IPO stands for Initial Public Offering. It’s sometimes known as stock market launch. IPO is a kind of offering where a company sells its shares to institutional investors. Institutional investors then list the shares for sale to the general public. Companies announce IPOs in order to raise capital for their expansion.</p>

<h1 id="secondary-offering">Secondary offering</h1>

<p>A company can sell its stocks and realize later that they’re doing well and decide to initiate another offering in order to sell more stocks to raise more money for expansion. This is called secondary offering.</p>

<h1 id="market-capitalization">Market capitalization</h1>

<p>Market capitalization or market cap is basically the value of a company in the stock market. This value is arrived at by multiplying the number of shares of a company by the price of the stock.

<h1 id="issued-stock">Issued stock</h1>

<p>Issued stock represents all authorized stocks that have already been issued to traders or investors. Although authorized stocks are not all issued, all issued stock is normally authorized. Some companies usually buy back the issued shares. Why?

<h1 id="treasury-stock">Treasury stock</h1>

<p>Outstanding stocks represent stocks that haven’t been repurchased yet, which means they are still possessed by the investors.</p>

<h1 id="trading-volume">Trading volume</h1>

<p>Trading volume represents the number of shares being traded every day. Trading volume says a lot about a stock’s liquidity.</p>

<h1 id="margin">Margin</h1>

<p>Buying on margin is the act of borrowing money from a stockbroker to buy stocks. It’s, essentially, a loan from a brokerage. Margin lets you buy more stock than you would be able to afford. To trade on margin, you must have a margin account.</p>

<h1 id="margin-account">Margin account</h1>

<p>A margin account is a type of account offered by brokerages that enables traders to lend money to buy stocks. For example, a stock trader may only have 50% of the value of the stock. With a margin account, they will be able to borrow the remaining 50% to be able to buy the stock.</p>

<h1 id="dividends">Dividends</h1>

<p>Volatility is the frequency and gravity with which the prices of stocks fluctuate. If the stock price swings a lot, it means the market is more volatile. When the volatility of the market is low, stock prices remain stable. When there is a lot of volatility, there is too much fear, which triggers panic. That’s when you see stocks being traded rapidly back and forth.</p>

<h1 id="rally">Rally</h1>
